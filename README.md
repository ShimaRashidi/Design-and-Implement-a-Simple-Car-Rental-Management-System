# Design and Implement a Simple library Management System
We aim to design and create a data management system for a library. This System should have a very user-friendly interface that user able to work with it very easy. This system helps to keep the book records. The library staff can add different books and can delete them later, check the book availability, search the books, issue, receive book, and management can check the report. Management can anytime view the total book status and library card status. The admin has to first register the student before issuing the book. Librarian can add/view books, issue, view issued books and return books.
